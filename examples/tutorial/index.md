This directory contains various versions of a minimal tutorial on how to use `benmet`, based on a simple number generator toy program.
Each subdirectory corresponds to a different programming language the step programs are implemented in:
- `Lua` (planned) contains step programs written directly in Lua 5.3 (as used by `benmet` itself).
- `Python` (planned) contains step programs written in Python 3.10.3 .
- `Shell` (planned) contains step programs in `.sh` files (tested with Bash, but compatibility with all shells would be great).
- `cmd` (planned) contains step programs written in `.cmd` files for cmd.exe .

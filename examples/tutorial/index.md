This directory contains various versions of a minimal tutorial on how to use `benmet`, based on a simple number generator toy program.
Each subdirectory corresponds to a different programming language the step programs are implemented in:
- `Lua` (planned) contains step programs written directly in Lua 5.3 (as used by `benmet` itself).
